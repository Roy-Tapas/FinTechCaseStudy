## Overview and Origin

* Name of project: **UNISWAP**

* When was the project launched? **2018**

* Who are the founders of the project? **Hayden Adams**

* How did the idea for the project come about and how was it funded? 

Uniswap is a protocol for decentralized exchange of crypto currencies. Uniswap was founded by Hayden Adams. Inspired by Vitalik Buterin's [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/) a few years ago, Hayden attempted to get his hands dirty to gain some solidity practice. His solidity training experience turned into a proof of concept for an on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol. AMM determine price of a crypto based on the ratio of two cryptos within a pool as opposed to counter party order books typically seen on centralized exchanges.

Subsequently Hayden received a grant from Ethereum foundation to continue his work to full-fledged Decentralized Exchange (DEX) platform which is now Uniswap. 

Uniswap consists of a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum network. That means entire process takes place on-chain and there is no centralization, and no fees going to any of the founders or third parties.

Uniswap was *funded* by Ethereum foundation, investments from  venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm Venture Capital, Union Square Ventures LLC and ParaFi.

Hayden received ~$11M series-A funding.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the project trying to solve?

 Traditional finance is being disrupted by blockchain and is rapidly evolving to **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** that doesn’t rely on central financial intermediaries (brokerages, exchanges, banks etc.). 
Uniswap is one of the core products in the DeFi revolution. Uniswap is a **decentralized crypto exchange (DEX)**. Uniswap’s DEX challenges traditional order-book based pricing method used by most centralized exchanges. When tokens are swapped, prices are decided by a **deterministic algorithm, called an automated market maker (AMM)** which automatically balances the pricing for a token pair depending on the demand and the available liquidity of each of the tokens in a pool.

DEX aims to solve problems of centralized exchange such as mismanagement, risk of hacking and arbitrary fees. However, DEX may mot have enough liquidity to make trading faster and efficient. 
Uniswap solves the liquidity issue by swapping tokens without the use of order books that means without relying on buyers and sellers creating that liquidity. 

Unlike most centralized exchanges, which match buyers and sellers to determine prices and execute trades, Uniswap uses a simple math equation (deterministic algorithm) and pools of tokens and ETH (Ethereum token) to determine the price and execute trades.
Uniswap pricing mechanism is called “Constant Product Market Maker Model”, where product of liquidity of two tokens under trade, always remain same, hence the name “Constant Product..”. 
Beauty of this model is, it ensures liquidity all the time, no matter how large the order size or how small the liquidity pool is. The model **asymptotically** increases the price of the token as the desired quantity increases. The premiums makes large orders (whale orders) prohibitively expensive. Pricing mechanism reduces *bid/ask spreads* typically found in centralized and regulated exchanges. 

Uniswap is developed for the community to trade tokens without platform fee and without involvement of any  middlemen. 



### Features of Uniswap:

Uniswap has 2 major features known as Swap and Pool:
- Swap: allows users to swap between different ERC-20 tokens.
- Pool: allows users to earn by providing liquidity. This is done by depositing tokens into a smart contract and the depositor will receive pool tokens in return. 

## Few advantages of Uniswap
**Self-custodial:** Traders retain full custody of their funds through crypto wallet such as meta mask. This mitigates the risk of losing funds if the exchange is hacked. 

**No Know Your Customer (KYC):** Uniswap allows self-custody of funds and that allows them to skip KYC. Users do not need to disclose sensitive personal information. This allows faster use of the platform and reduces the chances of hacking personal information. 

**Access to new coins:** New crypto currencies or tokens are listed in Uniswap faster than centralized exchanges because of the absence of vetting process with the exchange before the token is listed for trading. 


* Who are the projects intended users?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Small traders are Uniswap’s intended users. 
Uniswap’s current Market cap $22B 
24 hours trading volume ~$2.3B, captured 16% of DEX market share


* What solution does this project offer that competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

###Liquidity provision###
Uniswap is the go-to platform to earn fees by providing liquidity. Other DEX may provide higher liquidity fees, but those are often for pools with volatile tokens.

###First mover advantage and network effect###
Uniswap is the standard for automated market makers and now a household name in DeFi.

###Liquidity###
Uniswap is known for it’s high liquidity among it’s peers. Uniswap platform is the go-to choice for many crypto launchpads and new tokens. 

###Trading volume###
Uniswap’s 24-hour trading volume has been in the range of $2B to $3B. This was highest among all DEXs.  Pancakeswap recently surpassed Uniswap’s trading volume. But with the improvement in Ethereum block chain, Uniswap is expected to regain its dominance.

###Diversity of tokens###
Uniswap offers many more tokens than its competitors. This is primarily because of mainstream adoption of Ethereum, DeFi and ERC-20 tokens. Important to highligh that there are few tokens that are not available in Uniswap but available in other DEXs. Examples are tokens based on Binance Smart Chain.

###Ease of use###
Uniswap has a simple, intuitive, sleek and easy to use user interface.

###Community###
Uniswap has far bigger community than any of the other DEXs. Thanks to it’s network effect and Ethereum’s adoption. Uniswap's model has been copied by many. But, still very few DEX can compete with Uniswap. 

Uniswap is tried and tested. This platform offers many advatnages over others. However, gas fee on Uniswap is one of the major problem of the platform that is driving it’s users to other platforms such as PancakeSwap. With ETH2.0 launch on the horizon, transactions should be faster and cheaper. 


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 

Uniswap uses distributed computing that runs on Ethereum blockchain.
Responsive and intuitive frontend interface is built in React Native (type of JavaScript) 

Uniswap interface allows users to trade (swap) tokens, add liquidity, and create new pools. Under the hood, Uniswap pulls an array of information from smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to feed into the interface and populate data such as pricing between pairs, user balances, and swap rates.

Uniswap uses **Infura** to query information and fetch data like token swap rates, token balances, and other information from the Uniswap smart contracts. 

**Infura** is a method of connecting off-chain apps, such as Uniswap interface to Ethereum block chain.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Uniswap is in the field of Crypto trading.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

**Uniswap v1** was first launched on the Ethereum mainnet in November 2018. Uniswap became the first DEX based on Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. This model is based on a mathematical formula (instead of order books) to determine the price of tokens under swap. 

**Uniswap V2** Uniswal v1 was proof of concept that came with a huge promise. A better version Uniswap v2 was launched in May 2020. Major improvements are the following:
-	Much better and user-friendly interface
-	ERC20-ERC20 liquidity token pools to solve “ETH bridging” problem. Meaning users can swap one ERC20 token to another ERC20 token without ERC20 token to ETH first and then to another ERC20 token.
-	Integration with Oracle solution to get on-chain price feeds thus preventing price manipulation.
-	Introduction of flash swaps allowing users to withdraw as much as they wanted of any ERC20 token on Uniswap at no upfront cost as long as any of the following conditions is met:
1. Pay for tokens withdrawn
2. Pay for a percentage of token and return the rest
3. Return all tokens withdrawn  

**Uniswap V3** slated to launch in May is going to introduce an array of new features.

Recent DeFi boom has made Uniswap the most sought-after trading platform in the niche sector of digital assets. Uniswap has been the main driver for the rising prominence of decentralized exchanges and the catalyst for Decentralized Finance.

Uniswap is a great example of a non-custodial AMM. Users trade against the pooler assets - liquidity available in a smart contract, as opposed to with a counterparty as they would in traditional order book-based exchanges. They are the pioneer in blockchain based DEXs. 

Number of users grew exponentially over the years following the famous “hockey-stick” growth.

Daily trading volumes hit USD2.19 billion on October 26th, 2020 - which was a new all time high for the platform exceeding popular centralized exchanges such as Bittrex, FTX, and Bithumb and very close to the trading volume of Coinbase.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the project, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 

Uniswap has lost some ground to it’s competitors such as PancakeSwap because of high gas fee and network congestion resulting slower transaction. Many DEXs are coming up on different layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains with lightning speed and a fraction of Uniswap’s gas fee.
Uniswap is built on Ethereum blockchain. Reason of higher gas fee and latency is rooted in Ethereum, which is going to solve in Ethereum-V2 but that will take some time. Meanwhile Uniswap should focus on some intermediate solution to improve latency and reduce gas fee.

This will also solve transaction failure rates. Today users need to pay gas fee even if transaction fails. 

Uniswap competition offers add-on features such as staking and farming. This is taking away Uniswap users to those innovative DEX platforms. Uniswap should focus on how they can add more value to their users to retain user base and stay competitive.
